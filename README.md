# User-Management-System-Collections-Mastery
### **Project Overview**
This project is a refactored and enhanced version of a basic User Management System, redesigned using the Java Collections Framework to achieve better scalability, performance, and maintainability. The system manages users entirely in memory, replacing fixed-size arrays with dynamic collections such as HashMap and ArrayList. It simulates real-world backend logic without using any frameworks or databases, making it ideal for strengthening Core Java and Collections expertise.
### **Objectives**
-  Refactor array-based logic into collection-based design
-  Improve data access speed using HashMap
-  Practice List, Set, and Map interfaces
-  Implement sorting and filtering using Comparable & Comparator
-  Maintain login history efficiently
-  Ensure encapsulation, immutability, and data safety
-  Design code that is scalable and interview-ready
### **Technologies Used**
-  Java (Core Java – Java 8+)
-  Java Collections Framework
-  Console-based application
-  No frameworks / No databases
