# Collections-Mastery-User-Management-System
### **Project Overview**
This project is a refactored and enhanced version of a basic User Management System, redesigned using the Java Collections Framework to achieve better scalability, performance, and maintainability. The system manages users entirely in memory, replacing fixed-size arrays with dynamic collections such as HashMap and ArrayList. It simulates real-world backend logic without using any frameworks or databases, making it ideal for strengthening Core Java and Collections expertise.
### **Objectives**
-  Refactor array-based logic into collection-based design
-  Improve data access speed using HashMap
-  Practice List, Set, and Map interfaces
-  Implement sorting and filtering using Comparable & Comparator
-  Maintain login history efficiently
-  Ensure encapsulation, immutability, and data safety
-  Design code that is scalable and interview-ready
### **Problem Statement**
Refactor an existing array-based User Management System into a collection-based system using the Java Collections Framework. Replace the fixed-size array with a HashMap, using email as the unique key, to improve performance and scalability.
Enhance the system by adding features such as role-based user retrieval, sorting active users, and maintaining login history, while ensuring data safety, encapsulation, and immutability. The application must operate entirely in memory, without using any frameworks or databases.
### **Key Features**
-  HashMap-based User Storage
-  Role-Based User Fetching
-  Sorting Active Users
-  Login History Management
-  Encapsulation & Data Safety
-  Improved Scalability & Performance
-  Optional Thread Safety
### **Concepts Used**
-  Java Collections Framework - List, Set, Map interfaces, HashMap, ArrayList
-  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Encapsulation, Abstraction
-  Sorting & Comparison - Comparable, Comparator
-  Iteration Techniques using Iterators and Enhanced for-loops
-  Immutability - Unmodifiable collections, Defensive copying
-  Exception Handling - Custom exceptions for validation
